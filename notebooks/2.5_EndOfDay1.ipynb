Python is a versatile programming language that is used in Google Colab notebooks.\n","2. Images are just a large array of pixels that contain intensity values, which are interpreted as an image.\n","3. Images can be loaded into python and modified using various packages (i.e. imageio and numpy).\n","4. By convolving an image with various kernels, we can achieve image effects like blurring, sharpening or highlighting edges.\n","5. Images can also be convolved with small features to highlight that particular feature in an image.\n","6. Convolution operations can be done way more efficiently on a GPU.\n","\n","##### In day 2, we will be covering neural networks, and how to train two different types of neural networks to predict what digit is in an image and predict the age of people only by looking at pictures of their faces.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ecK93yhLKWtL"},"source":["# Interested in practicing programming further?\n","---\n","##### Since all of the notebooks in this module are not saved locally on your computer, a simple refresh of the page should return the notebook to its original state. \n","##### Feel free to play around with the code in these notebooks. You can do anything to the existing notebooks, and even add new code chunks if you want to do something completely different. \n","##### If you get stuck on something, a Google search should provide you with the answer to your problem."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D7TTqBUGbkZC"},"source":["# Extra credit activity: Components of a cell\n","---\n","##### We know that a cell is made up of many components including the nucleus, mitochondria, etc.\n","##### For biological applications, it is useful to highlight certain parts of the cell. We can do this by tagging cellular structures with _fluorescent labels_. \n","##### Here is an example of a _fluorescently labeled_ group of cells where the nucleus is _blue_, the mitochondria are _green_, and the actin cytoskeleton is _red_.\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/aewoessn/outreach-program-2021/blob/main/images/fluorescent_cells_rgb.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"fluorescent_cells_rgb.jpg\" width=\"388\" height=\"340\">\n","\n","##### Your goal is to complete three tasks with this image:\n","1.

Find the mean intensity of all of the blue pixels in the image.\n","3.
